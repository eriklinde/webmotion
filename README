# WebMotion

## A Chrome extension for mouseless web surfing

WebMotion is an extension that automatically scans every new web page you enter for links, and highlights *one letter* in each link. Users can then follow a particular link by simply pressing the *highlighted letter* on their keyboard.

WebMotion is smart enough to only highlight letters in links that are currently *in view* (otherwise there wouldn't be enough letters for every link). Should there be more links visible than the amount of letters on the keyboard, then users can hold down `ALT` to see the remaining links.

WebMotion normally highlights the links using a *red* color, but is smart enough to study the link and background color of each link. If *red* is not deemed to stand out enough, the letter is highlighted in *blue* instead. It achieves this by measuring the [color distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference).
